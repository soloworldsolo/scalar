/**
 * Groot has N trees lined up in front of him where the height of the i'th tree is denoted by H[i].
 *
 * He wants to select some trees to replace his broken branches.
 *
 * But he wants uniformity in his selection of trees.
 *
 * So he picks only those trees whose heights have frequency B.
 *
 * He then sums up the heights that occur B times. (He adds the height only once to the sum and not B times).
 *
 * But the sum he ended up getting was huge so he prints it modulo 10^9+7.
 *
 * In case no such cluster exists, Groot becomes sad and prints -1.
