/**
 *  Compute nCr % p
 *  Given three integers A, B, and C, where A represents n, B represents r, and C represents p and p is a prime number greater than equal to n, find and return the value of nCr % p where nCr % p = (n! / ((n-r)! * r!)) % p.
 *
 * x! means factorial of x i.e. x! = 1 * 2 * 3... * x.
 *
 * NOTE: For this problem, we are considering 1 as a prime.
